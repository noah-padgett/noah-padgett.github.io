      <description>This file extends the introduction I gave to simulating data from coin flips. Now, the goal is to show how the basics extend and can easily be used for helpful parts of study design planning.
Simulating More Complex Models We can easily extend the basic concepts of simulating from a simple population to simulating data from a more complex data structure. This is how we can simulate a simple regression model with one outcome (Y) and five predictors (x1, x2, etc.</description>

      <description>Before we get started with an introduction to simulation, we need to make sure that R and R Studio are downloaded on your computers.R is an open source and free statistical programming language.R utilizes user built ‘packages.’The package library is huge and you can find a package that does nearly anything you need it to and a large number of these are regularly updated.We will talk about packages a lot over the never few years so this is kind of tertiary.</description>
