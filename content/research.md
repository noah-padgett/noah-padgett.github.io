Throughout my life I have worked to develop my skills in mathematics and  statistics to help others. 
Statistics, research design, and measurement are foundational tools in a variety of research fields, and I can help guide to use of these tools to help make the best decisions we can in research.  

My current research is on developing a statistical way to incorporate how long people take to respond to survey items into the decision-making process. Iâ€™ve developed a way to account for people who may not be putting effort into their response. 
The goal is to use all available information from respondents and surveys, but also acknowledge that people may make mistakes or respond carelessly sometimes. 
That way when we use surveys to make decisions, we can have more confidence in the results.


## Research Websites

A major aim of my work is to be open about the tools and methods used.
Below are websites I created to document the research process and provide a useful way to communicate research results in a non-linear way.
This has helped organize the code and results of collaborations leading to easier discussion and porting to other means of communication.

* [European Journal of Persoanlity Special Issue on Measurement](https://noah-padgett.github.io/EJP-Special-Issue/)

* [Misclassification error in item-factor-analysis](https://noah-padgett.github.io/Padgett-Dissertation/)

* [Multilevel CFA Fit Statistics](https://noah-padgett.github.io/mcfa-fit/)

* [Multilevel CFA Parameter Recovery](https://noah-padgett.github.io/mcfa-para-est/)

* [Local fit approximation](https://noah-padgett.github.io/laplace-local-fit/)

* [Perceptions of Online Learning Projects](https://noah-padgett.github.io/pools-projects/)

The following are research websites developed for my collaborations with Dr. Greathouse

* [Esophagial cancer research](https://greathouselab.github.io/esoph-micro-cancer-workflow/)

* [Fiber Intervention Study](https://greathouselab.github.io/Fiber_Intervention_Study/)
