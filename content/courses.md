#### Available Courses

I am available to provide training ranging from introductory statistics to advanced psychometric modeling.
I strive to make my courses hands-on to provide value and experience to interested learners.
Courses can be tailored to the desired length last anywhere from one to five days, and the curriculum can be discussed to included topics as needed such as:

* Introduction to probability and inference,
* Introduction to statistical modeling,
* Introduction to psychometric modeling,
* Foundations of measurement in social science research,
* Advanced psychometric modeling, and
* Multilevel modeling, 

and more. My expertise is the intersection of psychometrics and statistics with a wide array of experiences setting up workflows for colleagues.

#### Online Resources

A major aim of my program of research is to provide useful resources to others.
Part of that has included the development of computational guides to texts that I have found particularly useful in my training.
I strive to regularly update (once of month) each text with either new content or fixes to previous content.
Feel free to reach out with comments, questions, or just to say hi.

The two texts I am currently working on are:

* I have a nearly complete (10/13 chapters) guide to *Bayesian Psychometric Modeling* by Roy Levy and Robert MisLevy. The guide is openly available [**HERE**](https://noah-padgett.github.io/Bayesian-Psychometric-Modeling/).
* I am in the beginning steps to my guide to *Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models* by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill. I plan to post the first section of this guide in the fall 2022.
