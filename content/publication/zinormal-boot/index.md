abstract = "A mixture model was adopted from the maximum pseudo-likelihood approach under complex sampling designs to estimate the mean of zero-inflated population. To overcome the complexity and assumptions of asymptotic distribution, the maximum pseudo- likelihood function was used, but a bootstrapping procedure was proposed as an alternative. Bootstrap confidence intervals consistently capture the true means of zero-inflated populations of the simulation studies."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
