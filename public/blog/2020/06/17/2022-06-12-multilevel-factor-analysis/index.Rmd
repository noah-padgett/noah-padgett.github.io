Multilevel confirmatory factory analysis (ML-CFA) is a fancy analysis.
So fancy in fact, I'm still not convinced if the analysis can be used properly.
My interest in ML-CFA stemmed from a study a colleague and I did as part of a meta-analysis on a cross-cultural resilience measurement scale (Renbarger et al., In Press).
Our aim was to use raw data from as many studies we could obtain and investigate the multilevel structure of the measure.
The key result we were interested in was whether the measurement of the construct significantly varied across groups.
We hypothesized that an invariant factor existed across levels (namely, resilience in youth).
We investigated what proportion of variance in resilience was between groups compared to within group.
This may sound familiar to an *intraclass correlation* from traditional multilevel modeling, and if fact this is what we were interested in (or at the very least I was lol).
Basically, the analysis boiled down to me being confused about how the actually use ML-CFA.
So, here is my understanding(-ish) of a basic(-ish) **multilevel factor analysis model**.

# The Model

The model at it's core feels quite intuitive.
The model starts with saying that the all items/indicators is a combination of individual component ($y_{i}$ or $y_{individual}$) and a group average component ($y_{g}$ or $y_{group}$):

$$y_{ig} = y_{i} + y_{g}$$
or equivalently, 
$$y_{total} = y_{individual} + y_{group}$$
The group component to individual items can be thought of as the *average* for the group.
In factor analysis though, we usually have many items that are reflective of some underlying construct of interest (e.g., youth resilience, motivation, perceived degree of safety, etc.).
When we have multiple items/indicators we have to replace our nice simple additive pieces into a sum of multivariate pieces (say for $J$ items),

$$\mathbf{y}_{ig} = \mathbf{y}_{i} + \mathbf{y}_{g}$$
where each is a vector of length $J$.
Part of the purpose of factor analysis is to develop a theoretical model for how each component contributes to the total observed score on each item.
Hence, the connection to factor analysis.
For a single item $j$, the observed score is a partial manifestation of the underlying construct of interest.
This results in a decomposition of the observed score into the individual (within group) contribution and the group effect
\begin{align*}
y_{ij} &= \tau_{ij} + \lambda_{ij}\eta_{i} + \varepsilon_{ij}\\ 
y_{gj} &= \tau_{gj} + \lambda_{gj}\eta_{g} + \varepsilon_{gj}
\end{align*}
where 

* $\tau$ is the intercepts at each level:
  - $\tau_{ij}$ is the within group average response to item $j$
  - $\tau_{ij}$ is the between group or *grand mean* response to item $j$
* $\lambda$ are the factor loadings that relate the construct(s) to items
  - $\lambda_{ij}$ is the strength of the relationship between the within group construct and the within group contribution of the total score for item $j$
  - $\lambda_{ij}$ is the strength of the relationship between the between group construct and the group contribution of the total score for item $j$
  - the pattern of loadings of each level may be different
  - the individual level loading matrix helps describe how individuals item response (or the level-1 units/respondents) are grouping together
  - while the group level loading matrix helps describe how the average responses to items groups together
  - I find it helpful to think of ML-CFA as a type of **clustering model** for the items/variables where we cluster items in two ways:
    1. by individual response
    2. by average responses to items
* $\eta$ are the random effects typically interpreted as the amount of a latent variable
  - $\eta_{i}$ is the individual level latent variable that varies over individuals within a group
  - $\eta_{g}$ is the group level latent variable that groups between groups so that all individuals within a group have the same value for this variable
  - Confusingly, the latent variables don't have to represent the same construct (rarely do they according to what seen published)
  - If they do represent the same construct, then $\lambda_{ij}=\lambda_{gj}$ such that the group latent variable $\eta_{g}$ then represents the group level deviation on the latent variable
    + If the above happens to be true, the model simplifies to
    $$y_{igj} = \tau_{igj} + \lambda_{j}(\eta_{i} + \eta_{g}) + \varepsilon_{ij} + \varepsilon_{gj}$$ 
* $\varepsilon$ are the error terms associated with each level

The full model, when put all together can be expressed inthe painful(ish) form of

$$\mathbf{y}_{ig} = \boldsymbol{\tau}_{i} + \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{i}\boldsymbol{\eta}_{i} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_g + \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{g}\boldsymbol{\eta}_{g} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{i} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{g}$$
where this model can even be parameterized in a variety of different ways as well.
Maybe I will dive in to those in a future spurt of random thoughts.

Anyways, through learning about this model I have still wondered what other insights can be extracted.
I still have much to learn about how these complex multilevel models can be used and in what other scenarios people find them useful.
Anyone interested in these types of models may find the work of Laura Stapleton very enlightening and I highly recommend her 2016 piece on construct meaning.
