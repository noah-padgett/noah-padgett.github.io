      <description>Recently, I have begun writing more and more. After a beer (or a few more than a beer) I was wondering how I ended up writing so much. Until I entered my current position as a PhD student I never thought writing would be a major aspect of my work. By work, I mean that I am researcher. My training is in educational measurement and advanced statistical methodology. A lot of what I consider my research is banging my head against a wall to get the darn computer software to quit returning errors during an analysis.</description>
